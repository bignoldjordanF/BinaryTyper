## What do I do?

You are given a random 8-bit binary string, and you have to type it into the computer as quickly as you can while retaining accuracy. You are given a score after each string entered, and a final score once the game has ended.

Each game, you will enter between six and ten binary strings.


## How do I get scored?

Each time you enter a string, you get a score based on the accuracy of your input and the time in which you entered it. For example, a perfect input within 2.5 seconds will give you a score of 100.

At the end of the game, your final score is just the mean average of each individual score.
